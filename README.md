# Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing marketing campaign performance using Python for data analysis and Power BI for interactive visualizations. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from marketing data, identify trends, and optimize future campaigns.

## Technologies Used
- *Python*: For data cleaning, analysis, and statistical modeling.
- *Power BI*: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation and analysis.
- *Matplotlib/Seaborn*: For basic visualizations (if used in Python).
- *NumPy*: For numerical computations.
  

## Features
- *Data Cleaning*: Preprocessing and cleaning raw marketing campaign data.
- *Data Analysis*: Applying statistical techniques to analyze campaign performance.
- *Data Visualization*: Creating interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key metrics (ROI, engagement, etc.).
- *Insights*: Extracting insights to help optimize future marketing strategies.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/sanyagupta31/marketing-campaign-analysis.git
    

2. Install required Python libraries:
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

3. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) to view the interactive visualizations.

## How to Use
- The Python scripts (data_analysis.py) can be run to clean and analyze the marketing campaign data.
- After analysis, use the Power BI file to interact with the visualizations and explore campaign performance insights.

## Results
- Visualizations include performance metrics like ROI, click-through rates, and audience engagement.
- Key trends and patterns are identified to assist in refining marketing strategies.
